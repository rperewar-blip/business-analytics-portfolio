# Sleep Timing & Behavioral Data Analysis

## Problem Statement
Analyze sleep timing data to identify behavioral patterns and trends using statistical analysis and visualization.

## Dataset
- Behavioral sleep timing dataset
- Time-based and categorical features

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
1. Cleaned and transformed raw sleep data
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Identified trends and correlations
4. Visualized sleep timing distributions

## Key Insights
- Consistent sleep timing shows lower variability
- Late sleep patterns show higher irregularity
- Clear trends across time periods

## Business Value
Demonstrates time-series analysis and insight communication skills.

## Files
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- HTML report
- Visualizations
