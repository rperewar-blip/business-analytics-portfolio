# McDonald's Menu Health Analytics

## Problem Statement
Analyze McDonald’s menu items to evaluate nutritional quality and classify items into health-based categories to support data-driven food insights.

## Dataset
- Public McDonald's nutrition dataset
- 250+ menu items
- Features include calories, fat, sugar, protein, and serving size

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- K-Means Clustering
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
1. Cleaned and prepared nutritional data
2. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Visualized calorie and nutrient distributions
4. Applied K-means clustering to group menu items
5. Interpreted clusters as healthy, moderate, and unhealthy

## Key Insights
- High-calorie density items are concentrated in burgers and desserts
- Beverages show high sugar despite low fat
- Clustering clearly separates healthier menu options

## Business Value
Supports nutrition-focused recommendations and data-driven menu optimization strategies.
